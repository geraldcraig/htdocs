    <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
    
    <p>To get started, get in a group of four and discuss what you know, or you think you know, about video games and
        violence. Your initial discussion should be based around the following points:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>examples of violent games you know/play</li>
        <li>the type of violence, i.e. fighting, shooting etc...</li>
        <li>what you feel when playing these violent games</li>
        <li>any real world cases of violence that have been related to video games</li>
        <li>your initial thoughts about the influence of violent games on behaviour.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
