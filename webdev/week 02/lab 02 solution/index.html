            <h1>Welcome to the Game Violence Webquest</h1>
        
            <p>
                This webquest is intended to provide students who are studying A
                Level English with an opportunity to develop their communication and
                writing skills.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                If you play video games, you have most likely come across some
                requiring you to fight or shoot people - and you were not being the
                good guy defending the poor and innocent! You will also have heard
                that there is a lot more violence today than before. It is no wonder
                then that some people are quick to make the relationship between
                violence in video games - and in media in general - and the increase
                of violence in real life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collaboration with peers and your teacher will be essential to the
                task. Class time will be allocated to this task but group
                collaboration will be necessary out of class also. Each group should
                arrange times appropriate for their members.
